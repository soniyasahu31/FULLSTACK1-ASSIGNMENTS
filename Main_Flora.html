    <h3>PLANT DIVERSITY OF ASSAM</strong></h3>
    <img src="../assets/plant2.jpg" alt="">
    <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify;">Favourable geographical location, diversified topography and ideal climatic conditions have made Assam very rich in biodiversity. The vegetation of Assam is primarily of tropical type covering areas of evergreen, semi-evergreen, grasslands, deciduous forests, grasslands and riverside forests. Some important tree species found in Assam are Hoooong (Dipterocarpus macrocarpus), Gurjan (Dipterocarpus tubinatus), Mekai (Shorea assamica), Kurta (Palaquium polyanthum), Nahar (Mesua ferrea), Sia-nahar (Keyea assamica), Sissoo (Dalbergia sissoo), Khair (Acacia catechu) etc.</span></p>

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="http://asbb.assam.gov.in/sites/default/files/swf_utility_folder/departments/asbb_lipl_in_oid_7/this_comm/bio.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="335" />India is one of the 17 Mega biodiverse countries in the world and accounts for 7-8 % of the recorded species. The State of Assam is a constituent unit of the Eastern Himalayan Biodiversity Region; one of the two biodiversity “Hot Spots” in the country. The climatic condition and wide variety in physical features witnessed in Assam have resulted in a diversity of ecological habitats such as forests, grasslands ,wetlands, which harbour and sustain wide ranging floral and faunal species placing</p>

<h4>The Bio-spectrum</h4>

<p>The climatic conditions cause prevalence of not and highly humid weather in this part of country and coupled with heterogenic physiography make possible luxuriant growth of a number of plant communities imparting Assam a distinct identity phyto-geographically, many a species are endemic to this region and it is also the center of origin for commercially important plants including Banana, Citrus, Mango, Zizyphus, and Tea. The array of floristic richness has prompted many a scholars to describe Assam as the “Biological Gateway” of North East. The eminent Plant Taxonomist and Plant Geographer Armen L. Takhtajan observed, “Cradle of flowering plants lies in between Assam and Fiji”.</p>

<h4>Diverse Plant Communities</h4>

<p>In the “Revised Survey of Forest Types in India”, Champion and Seth categorized as many as fifty one different forest types/ sub types for this region. But, the species diversity is so spectacular that it becomes often difficult to clearly identify separate riche to existing plant formations. However, broadly speaking the forest in Assam can be described into following types/ sub types.</p>

<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Tropical Wet Evergreen Forests.</li>
        <li>Tropical Semi Evergreen Forests.</li>
        <li>Tropical Moist Deciduous Forests.</li>
        <li>Co-ordinate the activities of the Biodiversity Management Committees;</li>
        <li>Sub-tropical Broadleaf Hill Forests.</li><li>Sub-tropical Pine Forests.</li>
        <li>Littoral and Swamp Forests.</li><li>Grassland and Savannahs.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p><span class="para" style="font-weight: bold;	text-decoration: underline;	color: brown;">Tropical Wet Evergreen Forests </span> are found in the districts of Golaghat, Jorhat, Sibsagar, Tinsukia, Dibrugarh and in a narrow stretch in Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts along foot hills. These forests also occur in the southern part of the State at lower elevations in Borail Range, and in Loharbund, Sonai, Longai and Dholia Reserve Forests in Cachar and Karimganj Districts.</p>
<p><span class="para" style="font-weight: bold;	text-decoration: underline;	color: brown;">Hollong (Dipterocarpus macrocarpus)</span> , the tallest tree of Assam and also the “State Tree” is the most predominant constituent of these forests. The associated species are Borpat, Jutuli, Sam, Dewa sam, Nahar, Teeta chap, Bhelu, Mekai etc.</p>
<p><span class="para" style="font-weight: bold;	text-decoration: underline;	color: brown;">Forests in Southern Assam</span> have, however, Dipterocarpus terbinatus(Garjan) in association with Mesua ferrea (Nahar), Mesua floribunda (Bolong), Michelia glabra (Champ), Palaquium polyanthum (Kathalua) etc.</p>
<p><span class="para" style="font-weight: bold;	text-decoration: underline;	color: brown;">Tropical Semi Evergreen Forests</span> occur mostly in Hallangapar, Abhoypur, Dilli, Dhansiri, Kholahat, Mayong, Garbhanga, Rani, Mahamaya, Guma, Haltugaon, Kachugaon, Gali, Pobha, Ranga, Kakoi, Nauduar, Batasipur, Dohalia, Singla, Longai, Bhuban Pahar, Sonai, Barak and Inner Line Reserve Forests along Northern and Southern parts of the State.</p>
<p>These forests have mostly medium size trees with few large trees. Shrubs, lianas, climbers, orchids and ferns grow copiously. At the fringe bamboos and canes occupy the space.</p>
<p>Species association and frequency of their occurrence vary from forest to forest, but the ones commonly found are Actinodaphne obovata (Petarichawa), Aesculus species (Ramanbih), Artocarpus chama(Sam), Albizia species(Siris, Sau, Koroi), Anthocephalus chinensis (Kadam), Duabanga grandiflora (Khakan), Castonopsis species (Hingori, Dhobahingori, Kanchan),Dillenia indica (Ou-tenga), Bauhinia purpurea (Kanchan), Lagerstroemia species(Jarul, Ajar,Sidha), Magnolia species(Phulsopa, Gahorisopa, Pansopa, Kharikasopa, Kathalsopa, Duleesopa),Mallotus species(Sinduri, Joral, Dudhloti, Buritokan), Michelia champaca(Teeta campa), Syzygium species(Paharijam, Mokrajam, Berjamu, Kolajamu, Bogijamu, golapjamu). Schima wallichii (Bolem,Ghugra), Terminalia species, (Hilikha, Bohera, Bhomora), Trewia nudiflora(Bhelkor), Hatipolia, Holok etc.</p><p>Moist Deciduous Forests can further be described as Sal Forests and Mixed Deciduous Forests. Sal Forests occupy considerable forest area in the Central and Lower parts of the State in the Districts of Nagaon, Morigaon, Kamrup, parts of Nalbari and Barpeta, Darrang, Dhubri, Kokrajhar and Goalpara.</p>
<p>In these forests, Sal grows in association with Lagerstroemia species(Jarul, Ajar), Schima Wallichii(Ghugra), Stereospermum personatum (Paruli), Adina cordifolia (Haldu), Artocarpus species (Sam), Ficus species(Bor, Dimoru, Dhupbor, Bot, Athabor, tengabor, Lotadioru, Khongaldimoru), Bischofia javanica (Uriam), Gmelina arborea (Gomari), Michelia champaca(Teeta champa), Terminalia species (Hilikha, Bhomora, Bohera). Toona ciliate (Poma) etc.</p>

<p><span class="para" style="font-weight: bold;	text-decoration: underline;	color: brown;">Moist Deciduous Mixed Forests</span> occur at the foot of hills in Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Karbi-Angong and N. C. Hills districts. Trees are mostly deciduous with Sprinkling of few evergreen and semi-evergreen species. Important plant species growing in these forests include Adina cordifolia9 Haldu), Albizia species(Siris, Kolasiris, Koroi, Sau) Alstonia scholaris(Satiana), Artocarpus chama (Sam), Careya arborea(Kumbhi), Dalbergia species(Sissoo, Medelua), Ficus species (Bot, Bor, Dimoru), Lagerstroemia species (Jarul, Ajar), Mallotu species (Senduri, Joral, Dudhloti) etc.</p>
<p>These forest harbour rich diversity of shrubby and herbaceous ground vegetation. Some of the Reserve Forests also have teak plantations.</p>
<p><span class="para" style="font-weight: bold;	text-decoration: underline;	color: brown;">Bordering Moist Deciduous Forests</span> in rain shadow areas are found forests which has been referred to as “Dry Forests” by Kanjilal. This type of forests are encountered in the Lumding, Langting, Mailongdisa Reserve Forests. A typical example is the Umananda Island in the middle of Brahmaputra North of Guwahati. Important species include, Aegle marmelos(Bel), Albizia species(Siris), Cassia fistula(Sonaru), Bombax (Simul), Alstonia scholaris(Satiana), Ficus species(Bor), Litsea species(Loban, Bagnola, Mezankori, Honwalu,Digloti) Melia azedarach(Neem), Moringa oleifera(Sajana), Orosylum indicum(Bhatgila), Mallotus species(Senduri), Terminalia species(Hilikha,Bhomora) etc.</p>
<p><span class="para" style="font-weight: bold;	text-decoration: underline;	color: brown;">Sub-tropical Broad Leaf Hills forests and Sub-tropical Pine forests</span> occur in the districts of Karbi-Anglong and N. C. Hills. Species commonly occurring are Alseodaphne petiolaris(Ban-hanwalu), Antidesma bunius, Betula alnoides, Cleidon speciflorum etc. Higher up pure stands of Pinus kesiya(Khasi-pine) are found particularly in the Hamren sub-division in Karbi-Anglong district.</p>
<p><span class="para" style="font-weight: bold;	text-decoration: underline;	color: brown;">Grass land and Savannahs</span> are grass dominated biomes and form the major part of vegetation in Kaziranga National Park, Pobitora, Orang, Sonai-Rupai, Laokhowa, Barnadi, Burachapori, Dibru-Saikhowa Wildlife Sanctuaries and some part in Manas National Park. Grasslands support important wildlife population in Assam. Important grasses are Apluda mutica, Phragmatis karka, Sclerostachya fusca, Saccharum species etc. These species grow gregariously at the onset of monsoon and grow even upto 6 meters tall.</p>
<p><span class="para" style="font-weight: bold;	text-decoration: underline;	color: brown;">Littoral and Swamp forests</span> have almost lost their identity because of biotic pressure on land. Presently sedges and grasses form the largest component of vegetation. Important species include Ageratum conyzoides, Alocasia species, Alpinia species., Amaranthus species., Bacopa species., Blumea species., Bombax species., Crotolaria species. etc.</p>



<h4>The orchids of Assam</h4>
<p>In Assam as many as 293 species of Orchids are reported which represent 44.39% of North.East species and 24.42% of species occurring in India.</p><p>Orchids as a group of flowering plants exhibit wide range of habits and have specific macro climatic requirements for their growth, development and regeneration. Assam orchids show all the habits and growth forms found in Orchidaceous taxa. Mostly they are epiphytes. Goodyera procera and Spiranthis sinesis are adapted to aquatic habitant whereas Vanilla pilifera and Galeola altissima are climbers.</p>
<p>Orchids grow to their magnificent best in the Evergreen and Semi- Evergreen forest and to some extent in Moist Deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Species belonging to genera Acanthephippium, Anoectochilus, Apostasia, Agrostophyllum, Coelogyne, Cymbidium, Dendrobium, Eria, Oberonia,, Calanthe, Eulophia, Geodorum, Habenaria, Malaxis, Nephelaphyllum, Vanilla, Zeuxine, Didymoplexis, Galeola, Bulbophyllum, Camarotis are the commonly found orchids.</p>

<h4>Bamboos in Assam</h4>
<p>Bamboos have gained considerable importance in the socio-economic life of people in Assam for the variety of uses they cater to. Altogether 38 naturally growing species of bamboo are recorded in Assam of which Bamboosa masrtersei is restricted in distribution to Dibrugarh district. Bamboosa cacharensis, Dinochlora compactiflora, D.india are restricted to Barak Valley. Chimnobabusa griffithiana and Oxetenanthera parviflora are restricted in distribution to N.C.Hills. Bambusa rangaensis grows wild in the Ranga R.F. of Lakhimpur district. Bamboosua vulgaris is the introduced species cultivated throughout Assam as ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Bambusa jaintiana and Melocanna arundiana are the species reported only from Assam.</p>
<p>There are no exclusive bamboo forest in the plains of Assam, bamboo grooves are found mostly along the edge of Reserve Forests. But pure bamboo forests occur in N.C Hills and Karbi Anglong districts predominated with Melocanna baccifera and Chimnobambusa griffithiana.</p>
<p>Bamboo is cultivated widely in Assam and every household grows bamboo in its bari land. Commonly cultivated species are Bambusa balcooa (Bhaluka bamboo), Bambusa tulda (Jati bamboo), Malocanna bacciferra (Muli bamboo), Dendrocalamus hamiltonii (Koko bamboo) and Dendrocalamus giganteus (Mokalm bamboo).</p>

<h4>Cane Diversity</h4>
<p>14 species of cane grow in cane brakes in forests of Assam. Calamus flagellum, Calamus floribunadus, Calamus latifolius are found widely distributed throughout Assam. Plectomia assamica and Plectomia bractealis are endemic species.</p>

<h4>Medicinal Plant diversity</h4>
<p>Assam is home to a good number of plants having medicinal uses in Aurvedic, Unani, Homeopathic and even modern medical practices. Quite a few of them are used by traditional village practitioners called Bej and people respond favourably to these traditional practitioners particularly in rural areas. Altogether, 952 plants species have been identified which have uses in medical practices in some form or other. Asparagus racemosa (Satmul), Curcuma aromatica (Ban-haldi), Emblica officinalis (Bel), Terminalia species (Hilikha, Bahera), Eugenia jambolana(Loha-jam),Garcina species (Thekera), Holarrhina antidysentrica (Dudhkuri), Hydnocarpus kurzii (Chalmugra), Litsea cubeba (Mejankuri), Ocimum species.(Tulsi), Phlogocanthus thyrsiflorus (Titaphul), Piper longum (Pipoli), Saraca indica (Asoka), Wedelia calandulacea (Mahabhringraj), Zinziber officinalis (Ada) are some of the most commonly used plants in treatment of various aliments. But the list is not exhaustive.</p>

<h4>Wetlands and Aquatic Plant Diversity</h4>
<p>Assam has more fresh water wetlands then any other state in the North Eastern Region. The two major drainage systems of Assam-the Brahmaputra and the Barak and in the flood plains of these river systems exist patches of marshy depressions and swamps as well as perennial water bodies of varying shape, size and depth called locally as beels, haors, jalah, doloni, hola, pitoni etc. Man made tanks like Joysagar, Sibsagar, Dighalipukhuri, Jorpukhuri, Hazarapukhuri, Rajhuwa Borpukhuri etc. were also dug by ancient Rulers of Assam. There are an estimated 3513 beels and hoars, 1,85,623 ponds and tanks and one reservoir in Assam. Deepor beel near Guwahati is a Ramsar site. Besides Deepor beel and some others mentioned above wetlands of importantce are Chandubi, Rata, Sohola, Taralipather, Phokolai, Mer, Sonbeel, Jamjing, Sagunpara, Motapung, Sarlane, Sareswar, Roumari, Khalihamari, Goranga, Sapekhati, Koladuar etc.</p>
<p>The aquatic plants species of Assam belongs to diverse habits and have distinctive characteristics. More than 100 such aquatic species have been identified and they can be described into following broad categories.</p>

<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Free floating hydrophytes: Eichhornia cressipes, Pistia stratioles, Lemna mino etc.</li>
        <li>Suspended submersed hydrophytes: Ceratophyllum demersum, Utricularia gibba etc.</li>
        <li>Anchored submerged hydrophytes: Hydrilla, Potomogeton, vallisnaria etc.</li>
        <li>Anchored hydrophytes with floating leaves: Nelumbo, Euryle etc.</li>

        <li>Wetland hydrophytes: Cyperus, Hygrophylla etc.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
    
<h4>Endemic Flora</h4>
<p>Endemic flora are plants which occur in a restricted area. Altogether 165 species of plants have been recorded which are restricted in distribution to certain pockets in Assam, though some of them show extended destruction in the N.E. Region and elsewhere in India. However about 100 such species have distribution restricted to Assam only. These include trees e.g. Accacia gageana, Adiantum assamicum, Alseodaphne andersonii, Alseodaphane khasyana, Angiopteris assamica, Cedrela fabrifuga, Cinnamomum cacharensis, Coelogyne assamica, Combretum wallichii, Dinochloa indica, Diospyros cacharensis, Dipterocarpus mannii, Eugenia cyanophylla, bamboos e.g. Bambusa cacharensis, Bambusa mastersii, Chimnobambusa griffitheana, orchids e.g. Bulbophyllum elassonotum, Bulbophyllum vireus, Dendrobium assamicum etc.</p>

<h4>Rare and Endangered Species</h4>
<p>From all available account following categories of threatened plants recognized by the IUCN have been reported from Assam.</p>
<p>Extinct: Bambusa mastersii, Cleisostoma arietinum, Cyperus corymbosus, Dendrobium assamicum, Dendrobium aurantiacum, Hetaeria anomala, Liparis stachyurus and Sapria himalayana. Paphiopedilum specerianum is reported to be extinct in wild.</p>
