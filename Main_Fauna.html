			<p>With five national parks, two of which are designated World Natural Heritage
		Sites by UNESCO, and several wildlfe and bird sanctuaries, Assam is ablessed
		land for wildlife enthusiasts. At the heart of it's mind boggling
		biodiveristy is the rich topography of Assam with it's lush hills and
		valleys dissected by the majestic Brahmaputra and it's many tributaries.
		Assam is home to over 180 species of mammals, including rare and endangered
		species like the great Indian one-horned rhinoceros, the royal Bengal tiger,
		the golden langur and hoolock gibbon, and a spectacular range of avifauna.</p>

		<p>
			Assam is part of the transitional zone between the Indian, Indo- Malayan
			and Indo- Chinese Biographical regions. Favourable climate, topographic
			and edaphic factors support luxuriant growth of diverse plant communities
			and create varied habitats. The Wet Evergreen, Semi-Evergreen, Moist
			Deciduous, Wet Savannah and riparian forest as well as extensive network
			of river systems and swamps, marshes and wetlands provide ideal conditions
			and suitable habitat for sustenance of wide variety of fauna be it
			mammals, primates, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, mollusks, birds,
			butterflies, moths etc. With existence of one of the most diverse faunal
			population; Assam provides the gateway for spread of both oriental and
			Palaearctic fauna to other parts of the country.
		</p>
		<h4>Mammalian Diversity</h4>
		<img src="../assets/Fauna/Mammalian.jpeg" alt="">
		<p>
			Assam forms the western most boundary for the Indo-Chinese species
			including primates and the easternmost limit of several peninsular
			mammalian fauna. The distributional extent of several Indian species
			including clawless otter, the spotted deer, the swamp deer, the stone
			marlin, the hispid hare, the great Indian one horned rhinoceros, the pigmy
			hog etc. have terminated in Assam plains. The distributional range of
			several Indo-Chinese fauna gets its sustenance from this region. Mention
			can be made of its sustenance from this region. Mention can be made of
			such species like clouded leopard, the marbled cat, the golden cat, the
			spotted linsang, the large Indian civet, the binturong, the crab eating
			mongoose, the ferret badger, the hog badger, the hoary bamboo rat, the bay
			bamboo rat etc .Assam is home to all the primate species found in the
			North Eastern region. Besides, many of the relict mammalian fauna of
			peninsular India particularly those occurring in the Western Ghats have
			close relationship with Assam and N.E region and therefore undoubtedly
			Assam holds a key place in the evolutionary process of divergence of
			mammalian fauna in India.
		</p>
		<p>
			Assam’s mammalian diversity is represented by 193 species which are widely
			distributed in this region. But of late some of the species like one
			horned rhinoceros, water buffalo, pigmy hog, swamp deer, golden langur,
			hoolock gibbon have their distribution limited to isolated pockets and
			protected areas.
		</p>
		<h4>Primate Diversity</h4>
		<img src="../assets/Fauna/Primates.jpeg" alt="">
		<p>
			Out of 15 Indian primate species 9 are found in Assam. Hoolock gibbon is
			the only ape found in India. The other primate species are golden langur,
			capped monkey, rhesus macaque, pigtail macaque, stump tailed macaque,
			Assamese macaque, and slow Lorries. Golden langur or “Sonali Bandar” as it
			is known locally is confined between Sankosh river in the west; Manas in
			the east; Brhmaputra in the south and mountains in Bhutan in the north.
			Pigtail macaque and stumped tailed macaque locally known as Gahorinejia
			Bandar and “ Senduiria Bandar” respectively are distributed in the
			Eastern, central and southern part of the state. Rhesus macaque, capped
			monkey and Assamese macaque are more or less distributed through the
			State. Assamese macaque and Rhesus monkeys are also found in villages and
			in urban areas.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most of the primates are predominately arborcal in nature but Rhesus
			monkey, Assamese macaque and stump tailed macaque are partly terrestrial
			also.
		</p>
		<p>
			Slow Lorries is the only prosimian found in Assam and the N.E. region.
			Locally known as “Lajuki Bandar” they are solitary animals and obligate
			canopy dwellers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of the habitant loss and fragmentation the primates are facing
			serious threat to their survival.
		</p>
		<h4>Avian Diversity</h4>
		<img src="../assets/Fauna/Avian.jpeg" alt="">
		<p>
			Assam is one of the “endemic bird areas” in the world. With 950 bird
			species the State is home to 53.5% of the bird species found in the Indian
			Sub-Continent, 17 species of birds are endemic to Assam and include
			Manipur Bush Quail, Marsh Babbler, Snowy throated Babbler, Tawny breasted
			Wren Babbler, Blyth’s Tragopan, Beautiful Sibia, Grey sibia, Black
			breasted Parrotbill, Chestrunt breasted partridge, Rusty breasted shortwig
			etc. 45 species of birds from Assam find mention in the Indian Red Data
			Book and include white winged wood duck, Blyth’s Tragopan, Greater
			Adjutant, lesser Adjutant, Leser whitefronted Goose, Merbled Teal, Beer’s
			Pochard, Palla’s Sea Eagle, Greater spotted Eagle, Green Peafowl, White
			rumped vulture, longbilled vulture etc.
		</p>
		<h4>Reptilian Diversity:</h4>
		<img src="../assets/Fauna/Reptilian.jpeg" alt="">
		<p>
			Assam’s varied physiography and habitant conditions support a rich variety
			of reptilian population. Gangetic gharial, 19 species of tortoises and 77
			species of snakes and lizards are found in the state.
		</p>
		<h4>Amphibian Diversity:</h4>
		<img src="../assets/Fauna/Amphibians.jpeg" alt="">
		<p>
			Assam and other parts of the N.E. region have 70 species of Amphibions
			reported from the region.. Gangenophis fulleri and Ichthyphis garoensis
			are endemic to Assam.
		</p>
		<h4>Fish Diversity:</h4>
		<img src="../assets/Fauna/Fishes.jpeg" alt="">
		<p>
			The Brahmaputra and Barak river system along with their tributaries and
			flood plain wetlands locally known as beels provide very condusive
			habitant for an array of fish species, Assam and other parts of N.E.
			region is recognized as one of the hot spots of fresh water fish
			biodiversity. 197 food, sports and ornamental fish species are reported
			from the region of which 185 are reported from Assam. The important
			ornamental fish species are colisa, Nemacheilus, Danio, Botia and Chaca.
			Commercially important fish species include, Rohu, Ktla, Pabha,Pabda
			Chital, Magur, Singi, Sol, etc. Over exploitation is posing serious
			threats to fish diversity and 25 species are identified as threatened.
		</p>
		<h4>Molluscan Diversity:</h4>
		<img src="../assets/Fauna/Molluscan.jpeg" alt="">
		<p>
			The river systems and extensive flood plains also harbour fresh water
			mollusks. So far 39 species of freshwater snails have been reported from
			Assam of which 10 species are used as food.
		</p>
		<h4>Butterfly Diversity:</h4>
		<img src="../assets/Fauna/Butterfly.jpeg" alt="">
		<p>
			These are amongst most beautiful creatures on earth. Around 1500 species
			of butterflies are reported from India of which nearly half are reported
			from Assam and N.E. India. The Swallowtail butterflies occupy an important
			place and the IUCN has identified the entire N.E. Region as Swallowtail
			rich zone under “Swallowtail Conservation Action Plan”.
		</p>
		<p>
			Butterflies play an important role in pollination of plants and besides
			being important aesthetically they play important role in biodiversity
			conservation.
		</p>
		<h4>Diversity of Moths:</h4>
		<img src="../assets/Fauna/Moths.jpeg" alt="">
		<p>
			Moths are also beautiful creatures and in Assam about 387 species of moths
			are reported. Most of the moth species are distributed throughout the
			State.
